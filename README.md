## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibevideo.git
cd vibevideo
```

2. Install the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
vibevideo
```

2. Open a video file using the "Open Video" button
3. Add effects from the effects panel
4. Adjust effect parameters
5. Preview the result
6. Export the processed video

## Creating Plugins

To create a new effect plugin:

1. Create a new Python file in the `plugins` directory
2. Define a class that inherits from `GlitchEffect`
3. Implement the required methods and parameters

Example plugin:
```python
from src.core.effects import GlitchEffect, EffectParameter

class MyEffect(GlitchEffect):
    name = "My Effect"
    description = "A custom glitch effect"
    
    parameters = {
        "amount": EffectParameter(
            name="amount",
            type=int,
            min=0,
            max=100,
            default=50,
            description="Effect intensity"
        )
    }
    
    def process_frame(self, frame):
        # Process the frame
        return frame
```

Ideas for future plugins:

Chunk Manipulation: You can read the video file in chunks and modify how those chunks are processed:

Skip chunks randomly
Repeat chunks
Reverse chunk order
Swap chunks from different parts of the file


Header Corruption: Carefully modifying headers while preserving enough structure for the file to remain readable
Codec Confusion: Force a video to be interpreted with an incorrect codec

Byte-level Manipulation

Byte Shifting: Shift bytes by a certain amount
Datamoshing: Remove I-frames, forcing P-frames to reference incorrect data
Bit Manipulation: Flip specific bits in the video data

Visual Processing Techniques

Frame Blending: Blend frames together at various opacities
Channel Shifting: Offset RGB channels spatially or temporally
Mosaic/Pixel Sorting: Rearrange pixels based on various algorithms

Ideas for Advanced Techniques
For more sophisticated glitches, you could try:

Raw Byte Manipulation: Read the file as binary and strategically corrupt it
Frame Interleaving: Mix frames from multiple videos
Compression Artifact Enhancement: Re-encode with extreme compression settings
Audio-driven Glitches: Use audio amplitude to drive visual glitch parameters

Implementing the Full Framework
Let's discuss how to structure this application for maximum extensibility and future growth:
Architecture Benefits
The plugin-based architecture provides several advantages:

Separation of Concerns

Core system handles video loading, UI, and effect management
Each effect is self-contained and responsible only for its transformation


Extensibility

Add new effects by simply creating new plugin files
No need to modify core code when adding effects
Effects can be discovered dynamically at runtime


Configurability

Each effect declares its parameters with ranges and defaults
UI can be automatically generated based on effect metadata
Effects can be chained and reordered through the UI



How to Extend the Framework
To add a new glitch effect:

Create a new Python file in the plugins directory
Define a class that inherits from GlitchEffect
Set class attributes for name, description, and parameters
Implement the process_frame method with your effect's logic

The plugin system will automatically discover and register your effect at startup.
Different Types of Effects
You can implement various levels of effects:

Frame-level effects - Manipulate individual frames (like the examples)
File-level effects - Process the raw binary data of video files
Temporal effects - Work across multiple frames with state
Mixed-media effects - Combine video with other inputs (like audio)

Beyond the Basic Framework
For more advanced features:

Presets and Chains

Save and load combinations of effects
Share presets between users


Real-time Processing

Optimize for live video streams
Apply effects to webcam input


Hardware Acceleration

Add GPU support for faster processing
Implement with CUDA or OpenCL


Custom Render Pipelines

Create specialized renderers for specific effect types
Handle different output formats

...
...
This architecture gives you the flexibility to start simple and grow the application organically as you develop more sophisticated glitch techniques.
