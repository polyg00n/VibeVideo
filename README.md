# VibeVideo
A vibe-coded plugin-based video glitch player.

#Me
Would like to use python to create a video glitch player that uses different techniques to distort the playback of an mp4 by manipulating the ways that the file is read. What I'd like from you is information about the parameters that can be manipulated to get interesting images from a video file, like chunking, displaying with an incorrect codec, etc.

Video Glitch Techniques in Python
I'd be happy to help you create a Python-based video glitch player! Manipulating how video files are read and displayed can create fascinating visual artifacts. Here are several approaches you can take:
File Structure Manipulation

Chunk Manipulation: You can read the video file in chunks and modify how those chunks are processed:

Skip chunks randomly
Repeat chunks
Reverse chunk order
Swap chunks from different parts of the file


Header Corruption: Carefully modifying headers while preserving enough structure for the file to remain readable
Codec Confusion: Force a video to be interpreted with an incorrect codec

Byte-level Manipulation

Byte Shifting: Shift bytes by a certain amount
Datamoshing: Remove I-frames, forcing P-frames to reference incorrect data
Bit Manipulation: Flip specific bits in the video data

Visual Processing Techniques

Frame Blending: Blend frames together at various opacities
Channel Shifting: Offset RGB channels spatially or temporally
Mosaic/Pixel Sorting: Rearrange pixels based on various algorithms

Here's a basic example of a Python script that could implement some of these techniques:

Advanced Techniques
For more sophisticated glitches, you could try:

Raw Byte Manipulation: Read the file as binary and strategically corrupt it
Frame Interleaving: Mix frames from multiple videos
Compression Artifact Enhancement: Re-encode with extreme compression settings
Audio-driven Glitches: Use audio amplitude to drive visual glitch parameters

Would you like me to expand on any of these techniques or provide a more comprehensive implementation for a specific effect?


#Me
I'd like to implement as many of these processes as possible. But I want to do it in an extendable way so that I can start with just a couple of them and add more as I learn how to make them. How can I structure the app to be able to add new menu items to implement these techniques?  Do I need to structure the app to be more of a platform? Should I think in terms of plugins? Maybe a node based architecture? What would make sense?

Building an Extendable Video Glitch Framework
An extendable architecture makes perfect sense for this project. You'll want to start with a few core glitch techniques while making it easy to add more later. Let's design a framework that supports this growth pattern.
Architecture Options
I recommend a plugin-based architecture with a simple core system. This gives you several advantages:

Modular design - Add new glitch effects without modifying core code
Composability - Chain multiple effects together
Configuration flexibility - Adjust parameters easily
UI integration - Automatically generate UI controls for new effects
…
…

Now, let's create a simple demonstration plugin to show how easily you can extend this framework:
…
…

Now, let's create another plugin that implements some lower-level file structure manipulation:

Implementing the Full Framework
Let's discuss how to structure this application for maximum extensibility and future growth:
Architecture Benefits
The plugin-based architecture I've outlined provides several advantages:

Separation of Concerns

Core system handles video loading, UI, and effect management
Each effect is self-contained and responsible only for its transformation


Extensibility

Add new effects by simply creating new plugin files
No need to modify core code when adding effects
Effects can be discovered dynamically at runtime


Configurability

Each effect declares its parameters with ranges and defaults
UI can be automatically generated based on effect metadata
Effects can be chained and reordered through the UI



How to Extend the Framework
To add a new glitch effect:

Create a new Python file in the plugins directory
Define a class that inherits from GlitchEffect
Set class attributes for name, description, and parameters
Implement the process_frame method with your effect's logic

The plugin system will automatically discover and register your effect at startup.
Different Types of Effects
You can implement various levels of effects:

Frame-level effects - Manipulate individual frames (like the examples)
File-level effects - Process the raw binary data of video files
Temporal effects - Work across multiple frames with state
Mixed-media effects - Combine video with other inputs (like audio)

Beyond the Basic Framework
For more advanced features:

Presets and Chains

Save and load combinations of effects
Share presets between users


Real-time Processing

Optimize for live video streams
Apply effects to webcam input


Hardware Acceleration

Add GPU support for faster processing
Implement with CUDA or OpenCL


Custom Render Pipelines

Create specialized renderers for specific effect types
Handle different output formats



This architecture gives you the flexibility to start simple and grow the application organically as you develop more sophisticated glitch techniques.
